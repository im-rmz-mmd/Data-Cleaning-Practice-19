## 🚗 From Mess to Insight — The Story of a Dataset Full of Fuel!

📦 I started with a dataset full of missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.  
🎯 My goal wasn’t just to clean it — I wanted to pull **meaningful insight** from the mess.

🧹 Using **Pandas**, I removed outliers, renamed and standardized columns, and exported a clean dataset — ready for **Power BI**.

### 🔍 Key Questions I Wanted to Answer:
- ⛽ Which cars are the most fuel-efficient?  
- ⚙️ What's the relationship between horsepower and weight?  
- 📅 Are newer models really better?

> 💡 **Lesson learned:**  
> Data cleaning isn't just pre-analysis — it's **real analysis on its own.**
